# Character Recognition with CNN 🧠

This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based solution for a **character recognition** task, created as a coursework project in data analysis.  
The goal is to recognize letters or digits from images using deep learning techniques.

## 📘 Project Overview

- `solutionv2.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with the full workflow (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization)  
- `slides.pptx` — final presentation summarizing the results  
- `README.md` — this file
  
> ⚠️ **Note:** The original dataset used for training is **not publicly available**
> Therefore, the notebook cannot be executed end-to-end without access to the data.  
> However, the notebook and presentation demonstrate the complete analytical and modeling process.
